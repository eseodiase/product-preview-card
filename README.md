## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accessibility
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (developed entirely on my mobile device)

### What I learned

In the process of building this responsive product preview card, I learned breakpoints are way easier to add, plus additional features when you concentrate on starting with the mobile-first workflow development approach.

```html
<!-- This project was built with accessibility in mind.

Here is a sample of the add-to-cart button below:
-->

  <button type="button" aria-label="Add perfume to cart">
    <span class="icon" aria-label="cart icon"></span>
     Add to Cart</button>
```

### Continued development

Just started learning about Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) and would henceforth endeavor to build my web applications up to WCAG standard!
